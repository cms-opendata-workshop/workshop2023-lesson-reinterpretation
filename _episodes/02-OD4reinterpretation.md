## Open data for reinterpretation

How can we use open data for reinterpretation? 

### Open data for exact reinterpretation

Let's remember that exact reinterpretation only requires signal events.  Open data consists (will consist) of plenty of SM and BSM MC samples.  There is a chance that our signal of interest is already available in open data.

> ## Where is the need?
>
> We may ask the following question, especially for BSM signals: If CMS has produced the signal events, were not they already used in a dedicated analysis? What situations may trigger the reuse of these events in the exact reinterpretation context?

## Analyzing open data for reinterpretation

In many cases, we need to implement the analysis code for reintepretation.  We have several options:

* Use the code from the analysis team:
